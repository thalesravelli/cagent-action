# cagent GitHub Action

A GitHub Action for running [cagent](https://github.com/docker/cagent) AI agents in your workflows. This action simplifies the setup and execution of cagent, handling binary downloads and environment configuration automatically.

## Quick Start

1. **Add the action to your workflow**:

   ```yaml
   - uses: docker/cagent-action@latest
     with:
       agent: path/to/agent.yaml
       prompt: "Analyze this code"
       anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
   ```

2. **Configure API key** in your repository settings:

   - Go to `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or another provider's key) from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

3. **That's it!** The action will automatically:
   - Download the cagent binary
   - Run your specified agent
   - Scan outputs for leaked secrets
   - Provide results in workflow logs

## 🔒 Security Features

This action includes **built-in security features for all agent executions**:

- **Secret Leak Prevention**: Scans all agent outputs for API keys and tokens (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub)
- **Prompt Injection Detection**: Warns about suspicious patterns in user prompts
- **Automatic Incident Response**: Creates security issues and fails workflows when secrets are detected

See [security/README.md](security/README.md) for complete security documentation.

## Usage

### AI-Powered PR Reviews

For automated pull request reviews with a multi-agent system, see the [PR Review workflow documentation](review-pr/README.md). The workflow supports:

- Automatic reviews when PRs are opened
- Manual `/review` command in PR comments
- Learning from feedback to improve future reviews
- Customizable review guidelines per language/project

**Quick setup:** Add a workflow file that calls our reusable workflow:

```yaml
name: PR Review
on:
  issue_comment:               # Enables /review command in PR comments
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment: # Captures feedback on review comments for learning
    types: [created]
  pull_request_target:         # Triggers auto-review on PR open; uses base branch context so secrets work with forks
    types: [ready_for_review, opened]

permissions:
  contents: read # This is required to be a top-level permission to give `issue_comment` events (on forked PRs) access to the secrets below.

jobs:
  review:
    uses: docker/cagent-action/.github/workflows/review-pr.yml@latest
    # Scoped to the job so other jobs in this workflow aren't over-permissioned
    permissions:
      contents: read       # Read repository files and PR diffs
      pull-requests: write # Post review comments and approve/request changes
      issues: write        # Create security incident issues if secrets are detected in output
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      CAGENT_ORG_MEMBERSHIP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAGENT_ORG_MEMBERSHIP_TOKEN }}         # PAT with read:org scope; gates auto-reviews to org members only
      CAGENT_REVIEWER_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.CAGENT_REVIEWER_APP_ID }}                   # GitHub App ID; reviews appear as your app instead of github-actions[bot]
      CAGENT_REVIEWER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.CAGENT_REVIEWER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }} # GitHub App private key; paired with App ID above
```

See the [full PR Review documentation](review-pr/README.md) for more details.

### Using a Local Agent File

```yaml
- name: Run Custom Agent
  uses: docker/cagent-action@latest
  with:
    agent: ./agents/my-agent.yaml
    prompt: "Analyze the codebase"
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
- name: Run cagent with Custom Settings
  uses: docker/cagent-action@latest
  with:
    agent: docker/code-analyzer
    prompt: "Analyze this codebase"
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp-gateway: true # Set to true to install mcp-gateway
    mcp-gateway-version: v0.22.0
    yolo: false # Require manual approval
    timeout: 600 # 10 minute timeout
    debug: true # Enable debug logging
    working-directory: ./src
    extra-args: "--verbose"
    add-prompt-files: "AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md" # Append these files to the prompt
```

### Using Outputs

```yaml
- name: Run cagent
  id: agent
  uses: docker/cagent-action@latest
  with:
    agent: docker/code-analyzer
    prompt: "Analyze this codebase"
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

- name: Check execution time
  run: |
    echo "Agent took ${{ steps.agent.outputs.execution-time }} seconds"
    if [ "${{ steps.agent.outputs.execution-time }}" -gt 300 ]; then
      echo "Warning: Agent took longer than 5 minutes"
    fi

- name: Upload output log
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: agent-output
    path: ${{ steps.agent.outputs.output-file }}
```

### Prompt Files (`add-prompt-files`)

The `add-prompt-files` input allows you to include additional context files as system messages. This uses cagent's `--prompt-file` flag under the hood.

> **Note:** The `review-pr` action automatically reads `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` from the repository root — you don't need to specify them via `add-prompt-files`. Use this input for additional files beyond those defaults.

**File Resolution (handled by cagent):**
- Searches up the directory hierarchy (like `.gitignore`)
- Also checks the home folder (`~/`)
- Files are added as system messages, not appended to the user prompt

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Additional files beyond the auto-discovered AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
add-prompt-files: "CONTRIBUTING.md,docs/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md"

# With custom working directory
working-directory: ./src
add-prompt-files: "STYLE_GUIDE.md"  # Found via hierarchy search
```

## Outputs

| Output                  | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exit-code`             | Exit code from cagent run                                |
| `output-file`           | Path to the output log file                              |
| `mcp-gateway-installed` | Whether mcp-gateway was installed (`true`/`false`)       |
| `execution-time`        | Agent execution time in seconds                          |
| `verbose-log-file`      | Path to the full verbose agent log (includes tool calls) |
| `secrets-detected`      | Whether secrets were detected in output                  |
| `prompt-suspicious`     | Whether suspicious patterns were detected in user prompt |

          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

      - name: Code Quality Analysis
        uses: docker/cagent-action@latest
        with:
          agent: docker/code-quality-analyzer
          prompt: "Analyze code quality and best practices"
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```
